# Map Portfolio
#### Welcome to my Map Portfolio GitHub Page. Here you will find some samples of work I have designed and created from previous labs in my graduate degree.

## Dam Barriers on Streams
#### This is a map of dam barriers on streams in Vancouver Island. You can see accessible habitat in blue and inaccessible stream habitat in red. These areas mean that salmon cannot spawn in these habitats and swim upstream back into the ocean. Dam junctions are important to view because they block streams and block flow accessibility in rivers.

## Chinook Salmon Stream Habitat Accessibility
#### This map shows stream accessibility of Chinook Salmon along Vancouver Island's stream networks on the southwest corner. The habitat is shown in green to show the boundary of where Chinook salmon spawn. Streams that are accessible are shown in blue and those that are inaccessible are shown in pink. Dam junctions are included to show where streams are blocked by dams.

## Marine Sanctuaries
#### This is a map of proposed false killer whale sanctuaries for marine spatial planning in Hawaii. Areas with red lines are proposed areas that will be beneficial for false killer whale populations as they are spotted in the Hawaiian waters frequently there. The yellow portion shows areas that false killer whales interact with human activities, and the pink shows undisturbed false killer whale areas.  It is also important to note that the farther away from the island, the less disturbance there is on their populations.
